## Project Overview
This project presents a Financial KPI Dashboard developed in Excel to simulate a structured monthly performance review process. The dashboard consolidates revenue, expense, profitability, and operational metrics into a single reporting interface designed to support management decision-making.
The model focuses on tracking Budget vs Actual performance across business units, identifying cost variances, evaluating revenue trends, and assessing overall profitability through EBIT analysis. In addition to financial metrics, the dashboard incorporates working capital indicators such as debtors aging and operational drivers including hiring trends, enabling a more integrated performance view.
The objective of this dashboard is to demonstrate how raw financial data can be transformed into an executive-ready reporting framework that highlights performance gaps, cost pressures, and growth trends in a clear and structured format.

##Business Objective:
The objective of this dashboard is to support structured financial performance review by comparing actual results against budget and prior year benchmarks. The model focuses on identifying revenue trends, monitoring departmental cost variances, evaluating profitability movement, and assessing working capital indicators.
It is designed to reflect a month-end management reporting process where financial and operational metrics are reviewed to understand performance gaps, cost pressures, and overall business direction.


## Key Metrics Covered:
The dashboard tracks revenue and expense performance against budget, highlighting monthly and annual variance trends. It evaluates EBIT movement to assess profitability impact and monitors performance target achievement to identify execution gaps.
In addition, the model includes department-level cost analysis and a debtors aging view to provide insight into working capital management and cost distribution across business units.

##Tools & Approach:
The dashboard was developed in Microsoft Excel using a Budget vs Actual framework. Variance analysis was applied to measure performance gaps, and data from multiple sheets was consolidated into a single reporting view for management review.

## Practical Application:
This dashboard reflects how monthly financial performance is typically reviewed in an FP&A setting. It brings together revenue, cost, and profitability metrics in one place, making it easier to identify where the business is performing as planned and where corrective action may be required.
By tracking budget variances, department-level costs, EBIT movement, and debtor trends, the model supports structured performance discussions and helps highlight areas that may require tighter cost control or operational focus.
