## Financial_KPI_Dashboard_Budget_vs_Actual

Project Overview
---
This project presents a Financial KPI Dashboard built in Excel to review month-on-month performance against budget and prior year results. The dashboard consolidates revenue, expenses, EBIT, and operational indicators into a single reporting view.
The focus of the model is on identifying budget variances, tracking revenue growth, monitoring departmental cost behavior, and assessing profitability trends. It also include debtor aging and hiring data to link operational activity with financial impact.
The objective is to demonstrate how financial data can be structured into a clear reporting format that supports performance review and cost control discussions.

Business Objective:
---
The dashboard is designed to simulate a month-end performance review process. It compares actual results with budgeted figures, highlights key variances, and provides visibility into cost distribution and profitability movement across business units.

Key Metrics Covered:
---
The dashboard tracks revenue and expense performance against budget, highlighting monthly and annual variance trends. It evaluates EBIT movement to assess profitability impact and monitors performance target achievement to identify execution gaps.
In addition, the model includes department-level cost analysis and a debtors aging view to provide insight into working capital management and cost distribution across business units.

Tools & Approach:
---
The dashboard was developed in Microsoft Excel using a Budget vs Acctual framework. Variance analysis was applied to measure performance gaps, and data from multiple sheets was consolidated into a single reporting view for management review.

Practical Application:
---
This dashboard reflects how monthly financial performance is typically reviewed in an FP&A setting. It brings together revenue, cost, and profitability metrics in one place, making it easier to identify where the business is performing as planned and where corrective action may be required.
By tracking budget variances, department-level costs, EBIT movement, and debtor trendss, the model supports structured performance discussions and helps highlight areas that may require tighter cost control or operational focus.
