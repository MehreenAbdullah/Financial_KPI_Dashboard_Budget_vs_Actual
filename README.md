## Financial_KPI_Dashboard_Budget_vs_Actual

Project Overview
---
This is a Financial KPI Dashboard built in Excel to track month-on-month performance against budget and prior year results. It brings together revenue, expenses, EBIT, and key operational indicators into a single reporting view for structured analysis. The focus is on identifying budget variances, monitoring revenue growth, evaluating departmental cost behavior, and understanding profitability trends. It also incorporates debtor aging and hiring data to connect operational activity with financial impact. The purpose is to show how financial information can be organized into a clear, decision-focused reporting format for performance monitoring and cost control discussions.

Business Objective:
---
The dashboard is designed to simulate a month-end performance review process. It compares actual results with budgeted figures, highlights key variances, and provides visibility into cost distribution and profitability movement across business units.

Key Metrics Covered:
---
The dashboard tracks revenue and expense performance against budget, highlighting monthly and annual variance trends. It evaluates EBIT movement to assess profitability impact and monitors performance target achievement to identify execution gaps.
In addition, the model includes department-level cost analysis and a debtors aging view to provide insight into working capital management and cost distribution across business units.

Tools & Approach:
---
The dashboard was developed in Microsoft Excel using a Budget vs Acctual framework. Variance analysis was applied to measure performance gaps, and data from multiple sheets was consolidated into a single reporting view for management review.

Practical Application:
---
This dashboard reflects how monthly financial performance is typically reviewed in an FP&A setting. It brings together revenue, cost, and profitability metrics in one place, making it easier to identify where the business is performing as planned and where corrective action may be required.
By tracking budget variances, department-level costs, EBIT movement, and debtor trendss, the model supports structured performance discussions and helps highlight areas that may require tighter cost control or operational focus.
